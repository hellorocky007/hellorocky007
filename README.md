## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

### 1. **IoT-Based Smart Car Parking System**
- **Technologies**: Arduino, ESP32, ThingSpeak, React.js, Ultrasonic Sensors, Three.js.
- **Project Overview**: Iâ€™m developing an IoT system that uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect available parking spaces in real-time. The data is captured by **ESP32** and sent to **ThingSpeak**, where it is visualized in a **React.js** frontend. Additionally, I am using **Three.js** to create 3D visualizations of the parking area.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time sensor data monitoring via **ThingSpeak API**.
  - Dynamic 3D visualizations for user-friendly experience.
  - Accurate parking space tracking with **Ultrasonic Sensors**.

### 2. **Food Delivery Web Application**
- **Technologies**: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Redux.
- **Project Overview**: This project focuses on building a **scalable food delivery platform**. The app includes features like **secure user authentication**, dynamic **search functionality**, and an **interactive cart management system**. 
- **Key Features**:
  - Secure **JWT-based authentication** for users.
  - Efficient **state management** with **Redux**.
  - User-friendly UI for **order processing** and **cart management**.
